abstract = "Context
Systematic mapping studies are used to structure a research area, while systematic reviews are focused on gathering and synthesizing evidence. The most recent guidelines for systematic mapping are from 2008. Since that time, many suggestions have been made of how to improve systematic literature reviews (SLRs). There is a need to evaluate how researchers conduct the process of systematic mapping and identify how the guidelines should be updated based on the lessons learned from the existing systematic maps and SLR guidelines.
Objective
To identify how the systematic mapping process is conducted (including search, study selection, analysis and presentation of data, etc.); to identify improvement potentials in conducting the systematic mapping process and updating the guidelines accordingly.
Method
We conducted a systematic mapping study of systematic maps, considering some practices of systematic review guidelines as well (in particular in relation to defining the search and to conduct a quality assessment).
Results
In a large number of studies multiple guidelines are used and combined, which leads to different ways in conducting mapping studies. The reason for combining guidelines was that they differed in the recommendations given.
Conclusion
The most frequently followed guidelines are not sufficient alone. Hence, there was a need to provide an update of how to conduct systematic mapping studies. New guidelines have been proposed consolidating existing findings."

	abstract = {The objective of this paper was to assess the usage and effectiveness of RFID technology in Allama Iqbal Library. Care has been taken to examine the post RFID benefits and benefits of Virtua software used for installing RFID. Further, threats and other risks of RFID have also been highlighted. A structured questionnaire was used as the key instrument for data collection. Interviews and observations were also conducted wherever the questionnaires failed. The library is at the forefront in successfully implementing RFID technology thus reducing the time and staff required for circulation of books and, simultaneously, increasing book transactions per hour. The study reveals that majority of users (80.70\%) are using self check-in/out while a small percentage (19.29) still relies on manual issue and return. Though a fully RFID enabled library system is in place, the manual circulation counter has not been abandoned. An important finding is that the inventory control never conducted prior to RFID was carried out easily by hand held inventories within a short time. Since the study is about the latest developments of automation of a leading library; it will be helpful for other university/college libraries of Jammu and Kashmir in particular and India in general to modernize their services and operations by implementing RFID technology.},
